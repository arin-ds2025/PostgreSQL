-- we've to use DELETE FROM keywords to choose the table
DELETE FROM phones

-- then we've to specify the row using WHERE keyword
WHERE name = 'S5620 Monte' ;

-- if we choose 
WHERE name != 'S5620 Monte'; --or WHERE name <> 'S5620 Monte';
-- except that row , all other rows will be deleted from the table



-- after deletion, we can check the whole table by
SELECT * FROM phones;


-- if we want to get back that row then we've to use INSER INTO (name,manufacture,price,units_sold)
-- and then VALUES('S5620 Monte', 'Samsung', 189, 3011);  that's it
