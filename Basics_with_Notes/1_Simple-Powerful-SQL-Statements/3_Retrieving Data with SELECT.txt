SELECT * FROM cities; -- here * means take all rows of cities

-- but we can take specific row or rows by row name instead of using *
-- example:

SELECT area,country,name FROM cities;  -- for multiple rows, here the rows will print according to the name which 
-- is given first then second and then third

-- or

SELECT population FROM cities; -- for single row
