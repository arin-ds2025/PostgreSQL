-- we can access photos in photos table , using user_id like this:
SELECT * FROM photos 
WHERE user_id = 4; -- we'll get all rows of photos table , whose has user_id = 4


-- but from users table, we want to access those photos , by that foreign key or user_id
-- so for this,
SELECT username,url FROM photos -- here username and photos come from different tables but it'll work for the JOIN keyword
JOIN users ON users.id = photos.user_id; -- by using this JOIN keywork and then using ON keyword to indicate primary key,, 
-- we can access photos user_id .. mainly find those user_id whose got match with primary key of users
