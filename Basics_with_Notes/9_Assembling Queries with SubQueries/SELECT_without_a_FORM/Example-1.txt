SELECT (
	SELECT MAX(price) -- here we've to select those things which will return only one value.. if it returns more than one value and it'll through error
	FROM products
);



-- x x x x x x
SELECT (
	SELECT price -- this is not valid, cause it'll return more than one value. but if we put any WHERE clause which can return one value,then it'll work
	FROM products
);



-- more operation , like:
SELECT (
	SELECT AVG(price) FROM products
) / (
	SELECT MAX(price) FROM products   
) AS ratio_avg_max; -- we can do this also for a single value.. and here the ratio of avg and max price will return just one value


-- we can also print multiple single things, like:
SELECT ( SELECT MAX(price) as mxp FROM products ) , (SELECT MAX(weight) as mxw FROM products), 
(SELECT AVG(weight) AS avg_w FROM products) -- etc
